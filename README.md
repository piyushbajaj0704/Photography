# Photography


## Tips: 
- Always look for Angles.
- Shoot through something.
- Look for creative composition which is not common for common places. 
- Dont use more than F16 on full frame, F11 on APS-C to avoid diffractions.
- Use correct balance of positive and negative space. Negative space should point to the positive space (eg subject).
- Always check for focus after every shot, exposure can be dealt later but not focus.
- To avoid using ND Filter during day time, use Multiple Exposure Mode to merge 2 same short exposure photos.
- To remove people from crowded location, use long exposure with ND Filter during daytime.
- To focus everything in photo, use focus stacking technique using Photoshop.
- For landscape, use F8-F11 and use focus stacking if possible. 
- Analyze the compose the photos
- Always try to add some foreground ele to landscape or portraits
- Can try to use MUP to reduce shutter shock for teck sharp images
- TEST: Find the sharpest aperture of your lenses mostly in landscapes/far away / near away objects.
- AFS even works when subject is moving parallel and not into/out of camera.  -> NOT SURE 
- TEST: Aim for Single Point focus and try to move the focus point
- Use single point sf and not wide area AF


## Long Exposure:
- Use Tripods.
- Turn off any image stabilization when using Tripods (Given its not windy and tripod is not moving
- Shoot in Manual Focus, do autofocus with highest aperture if needed before switching to Manual as we don't want camera to refocus. Change Aperture back.  
- Aperture: For Landscapes: F8-F11, For starburst type: F14-F16
- SS: If objects are moving fast: 1-3 sec, If slow: 10-30 seconds
- ISO: Depends on the light meter, change. Try for lowest ISO.
- Bulb Mode: If want to shoot for more than 30 seconds
- WideAngle lens: Don't forget to place an object nearby.
- ND Filter: Use it to decrease the SS to better streaks of lights and starburst.

Extras: 
- Try for architecture with moving clouds, water, cars.
- Use Water on ground for some creative shots.
- Use Extra torch colorful lights and be creative.

Check: If decreasing shutter speed, lighting meter change in real time and gives a warning of over or under exposure
ChecK: Bulb mode on our remote


## Steel Wood:
- Aperture: F5.6-F9
- ISO: 100
- SS: 10-15 sec.
- Lens: Wide Angle Preferred.

## Milky Way:
- Find an interesting foreground.
- Turn off Image Stabilization. 
- Focus: Set Focus to Infinity in Tikona or use Manual, Live View, Zoom in and focus on the brightest star and get that dot as small at possible manually.
- Lens: Tokina 11-16 is best for astrophotography for any kind.
- Moonless clear night.
- Best month in US: April - November.
- Location: Use DarkSiteFinder website.
- Direction: South generally.
- Aperture: As large as possible. (F<2.8)
- ISO: Last thing to setup. Take a quick snap at 2000 and set accordingly. 
- SS: 500/Computed Focal Length (Not Optimal, better use NPF Rule) 
- Shoot in Manual Mode.
- Try to have less focal length < 35mm(Computed)
- TEST: Quiet Mode.
- Tip: Turn brightness all the way down, to see the actual brightness of the taken image.
- Tip: For light painting, decrease ISO 


## ND Filters:
- Reduces the amount of light going through the lens.
- Mostly use in bright timelapse.
- When one wants to increase Aperature but not have too much light.

## Circular Polaizer:
- Mostly for landscapes.
- Reduces reflection on water.
- Deepens intensity of blue skies
- Reduces or eliminates glare 
- Add a little extra color boost to your shots

## UV:
- Reduces blueish glare but rarely.
- Mostly for protection though. 
- Protecting your camera’s sensor from harmful long-term exposure to UV rays
    - Don't buy cheap one. Also, difficult to clean if cheap.
- Try not to use it everytime during shooting as it might degrade the quality of photos.

## Portraits:
- Focus is most important. n.ot always at 1.4 o1.8 cause not all maybe in sharp focud, say both eyes 
- To get the depth in your image use f5.6 f8 f11 or f16.
- For test, if tested on f1.8 to f16, f8
- Add Motion

## Low Light Potrait:
- Flash might be helpful.
- To get the best shallow depth of field, use the widest aperature.
- If 50mm, set SS t0 1/50
- If 85mm, set SS to 1/100
- Don't set ISO too low for underexpose.
- Reduce noise in PP by using masking.


## Wide Angle Lenses:

- Main power: Distortion - Make foreground look very large and background very small.
- Background will be pushed far back from the subject.ddddss
- Landscapes, Street Shots, Architecture.caus
- Landscapes: 
    - Find a foreground, it could be a rock, tree, bushes with interesting background, next get really close to it.
    - Go down and try to see if you get an amazing picture close to the ground.
- Portraits:
    - Not to use it for potraits, unless creative.
- Environmental Portraits:
    - Place a person at the center but far away and capture the whole background.
- StreetShots/Architecture/Enclosed Space:
    - For fit it all in. 
- Corners at f/2.8 are obviously softer than the center.
- By f/4, corners are looking better. By f/5.6, corners are looking very good and by f/8, they are great.
- The 16mm focal length remains this lens' weakest setting. I have been especially pleased with the real world image sharpness this lens delivers for landscape photography at f/8 or so.
- Some barrel distortion is present at 11mm. The barrel distortion transitions to nearly no distortion at 14-16mm.
- Tokina 11-16 images show noticeable CA (Chromatic Aberration) in the mid and peripheral image circle (corners) at all focal lengths.
- The quality of the background blur that you can create is not remarkable.

## Prime Lenses:
- It is versatile and perfect for travel and portrait pictures as well as general photography.
- Its AF is actually a little faster than the AF-S twins (1.4G and 1.8G).
- The 50mm ƒ/1.8 AF-D provides sharp results when stopped down to ƒ/2.8 or smaller. Between F/3.2 and F/11 this lens is tremendously sharp. 
- When used wide open at ƒ/1.8 or ƒ/2, we did note some generalized softness.
- For the outdoor portraits, f/10 worked great with lots of depth.

## Light Painting:
- Low ISO
- Sharp Aperature. Test f8
- Wear dark clothes.
- Flash Lights.

## Metering:
- Matrix - Safe, 100% accounts for reflective light in the frame.
- Center Focus - Only accounts for 60-70% lighting of the frame, this might give under or overexpose picture.
- Spot: Only a small portion where you select. Requires more skills for best exposure. 

## Zoom Lenses:
- Make background closer to foreground with increase in focal length, gives a compression effect.

## Sharpness:
- Shutter speed depends on lens, faster shutter speed for long lenses.
- General Rule: Min. SS = 1/FL 


## Editing Quick Tips:

- Radial Adjustment Brush: For central or radial exposure to isolate the subject, more of like vigneting
- Color Intensify: use HSL Saturation to cherry pick color intensity.
